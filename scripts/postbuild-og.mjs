/**
 * Runs after `next build` (see package.json). Gives the Open Graph cards a
 * real file extension.
 *
 * `next/og` exports every card as a file literally named `opengraph-image`,
 * and the HTML references it as `/opengraph-image?<hash>`. On Vercel with the
 * Next.js preset that is fine; on plain static hosting — which is how this site
 * deploys — there is no extension to infer a Content-Type from, the response
 * ships without one, and Facebook/LinkedIn/X refuse to use the card.
 *
 * So: rename each card to `opengraph-image.png` and point the meta tags at it.
 * Idempotent; a second run finds nothing to do.
